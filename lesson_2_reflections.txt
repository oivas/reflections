What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Allows you to add file to it?... So you can have access to them?...

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

its between working directory and repository...before you make commits. I guess it allows you to add only files you want and not everything automatically
